name="NodePath Filter"
description="Filter nodes in Inspector NodePath dialog by type/class.
This is an attempt to solve this https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/934
say you have \"export (NodePath) var control_path\". This node should be Control
Then all you need is to create property named \"control\" (without \"_path\")  and specify the type:
var control:Control
Now only Control nodes can be selected in NodePath dialog.

There is also a setting in EditorSettings
(me2beats_plugins/nodepath_filter/include_derived_classes)
to allow selecting Nodes of derived (child) clases
(in this case, not only Controls but also Containers etc, but still not Nodes).

Known issues:
- when enabling the plugin, you should change node selection to make it work."
